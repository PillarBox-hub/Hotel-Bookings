# Hotel-Bookings
Using Pyspark to carry out research into a hotel bookings data found on Kaggle. 


# Introduction

The Hospitality industry seems to be on the rise by the day. A hotel bookings dataset found on Kaggle was used in this research using Pyspark and google collab. 
The dataset was made up of 36 columns. 


# Research Objectives 

1. Does the holiday period has an influence on hotel booking or do people travel more during the holiday period?
2. How car parking is used.And how different length of stays and family size affects the usage of car parking.
